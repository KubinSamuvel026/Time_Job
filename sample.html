        <h2>python basic</h2>
        <p>Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language known for its clean syntax and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for scripting, automation, data processing, and beginner-level programming because of its simplicity and large standard library. Common foundational topics include variables, data types (like strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries), control structures (such as loops and conditionals), functions, and basic file handling.</p>

        <h2>python web-development</h2>
        <p>Python plays a major role in web development through popular frameworks like Django and Flask. Flask is lightweight and flexible, ideal for small to medium projects, while Django offers a full-featured framework that supports rapid development with built-in tools for authentication, admin panels, and database interaction. Python’s web development stack also includes tools for templating (Jinja2), API creation (FastAPI), and working with databases using Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM. Its ease of integration and scalability makes it a top choice for backend development.</p>

        <h2>python ai-ml</h2>
        <p>Python is the most popular language in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) due to its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Tools like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn help with data manipulation, visualization, and model training. For deep learning, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are widely used. Python’s simplicity allows data scientists and researchers to quickly prototype and deploy models. It's also used in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, making it a cornerstone language in modern AI research and development.</p>
